The project presents an introduction to CNN and later a
practical application of AlexNet and VGG11. The accuracy of these two
networks calculated on the classification of the images contained in the
Caltech-101 dataset will be analyzed. In particular, the work focuses on
some techniques to obtain better and more robust networks such as:

-   Transfer Learning.

-   Data Augmentation.
